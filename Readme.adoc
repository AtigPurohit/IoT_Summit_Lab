== Content
This repository contains the material build for the 2017 Red Hat Summit.

The following sub-projects have been created

* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/Software_Sensor[Software Sensors]: a software sensor who could can be used to simulate sensor data creation.
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/BusinessRulesService[Rules Service]: a service which receives data from a defined AMQ-Queue, validates those against Business Rules and drops the results in another defined AMQ-Queue
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/RoutingService[Routing Service]: the service who receives, transforms and routes messages from one destination to the next.

== Lab 0 - Preparing the Lab Environment
If you should do these labs on an environment, which was not prepared for it,
please follow the https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/blob/master/BuildVM.adoc[instructions] on how to setup a lab environment.

== Lab 1 - Starting JBoss Fuse
We will start the JBoss Fuse server and will leave it running in the background. Deployment
to the server will be done "hot", which is definitely not a best-practice, but
for the sake of this lab, it's absolutely sufficient.

* Login to you lab-environment with

 username = 'demo-user'
 password = 'change12_me'

To start JBoss Fuse, please follow these simple steps

 * Open a new shell, as described in the previous section
 * Enter the following commands

  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd
  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab
  [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runJBossFuse.sh

* Wait for the Red Hat JBoss Fuse to complete the start procedure

* To be able to process MQTT messages, Red Hat JBoss Fuse needs to install the
'camel-mqtt' OSGi features. To to this, enter the following simple command on the
'JBossFuse' command prompt

 JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:install camel-mqtt

* Minimize this shell, as we don't need it at the moment

== Lab 2 - Building and Running the Software Sensor
The instructions on building and running the *Software Sensor* are located https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/Software_Sensor[here].

== Lab 3 - Building and Running the first Messageflow
The instructions on building and running the first Flow are located https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/RoutingService[here].

== Lab 4 - Building and Running the Business Rules Service
The instructions on building and running the Business Rules Service are located https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/BusinessRulesService[here].

== Lab 5 - Running the Software Sensor to create multiple sensor readings
In this lab we will use the `Software Sensor` from *Lab 3* to create a stream
of sensordata and will observe the effect our Business Rules from *Lab 7* has
on the data.

Please follow the following steps

 * Open a Terminal session or click on an open one

 * In the Terminal session, run the following commands

 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ cd
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runSensor.sh

You will see the sensordata being produced and received by the `Business Rules Service`, as
documented in the following image.

 * You can use the number of messages in the various Queues to verify that the
 `Business Rules Service` did filter the messages as expected. To do so,
 go back to your browser windows and navigate to the page showing the Queues
 and their content.

In this case, you can see that all produced 50 messages were place into and
consumed from the queue `message.to.rules` but not a single one was placed
into the queue `message.to.datacenter` by the `Business Rules Service`.

The reason for this are our implemented rules, which considered these values
to be in range and therefor not required for further processing.

 * To get a different result you could update the rules to something like in the
 following image

 * Now you just need to

 ** stop the running `Business Rules Service` task by hitting
`CTRL-C` in the right terminal session

 ** re-build and start the updated `Business Rules Service`
as described and done in *Lab 4*

 ** re-run the sensor

 ** validate the number of messages per Queue in the JBoss Fuse Browser
