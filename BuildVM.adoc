== Scope
This document is intended for those people who would like to perform the
IoT-Lab, as described in this repository.

The instructions are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 (RHEL) running on a VM or a physical hardware.

== Pre-Requisite
You will need to install a RHEL V7.3 with:

 * 2 CPUs
 * 4 GB RAM ( more is always good )
 * 15 GB Storage

During the installation please select to install the server with GUI.

For simplicity we will use the default setting for the disk partitions.

Also make sure that your network is activated.

I usually create a user called "demo-user" with admin rights, but you can call
your user whatever you want.

After completing the install precedure, register and upgrade your RHEL installation:


```
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager register --username=rhnuser --password=rhnpasswd`
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=pool_id
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo yum upgrade

```
== Provisioning the Gateway
=== Pre-Requisite
-Install git

  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install git

-Install Ansible

  [user@localhost ~]$ rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install ansible
  
-Download JBOSS Fuse 6.3.0 from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=jboss.fuse&downloadType=distributions[Red Hat Customer Portal] and save it in the Downloads folder

-Download the provisioning script  
  [user@localhost ~]$ git clone -b Summit-2017-IshuChanges-Host https://github.com/RedHatDemoCentral/IoT_Summit_Lab.git

 * Update the Ansible playbook BuildGW file [Virtual-IoT-Gateway/Ansible/BuildGW] for the username for your gateway: *set_fact: user='user name'*
 
_Note: For the lab, we're using username = 'demo-user' and password = 'change12_me'._

 * Launch the Ansible playbook by entering the following commands:
  
  [user@localhost ~]$ cd Virtual_IoT_Gateway/Ansible
  [user@localhost ~]$ ansible-playbook BuildGW --ask-become-pass
  
*Let the Ansible run through the tasks in the playbook. Once Ansible is finished, we're ready to start work directly on the Gateway*

_Note: If you want to provision the Gateway remotely, you will need to update the host file [Ansible/host] with IP address of the Gateway and place your public key on the Gateway https://github.com/redhat-iot/Virtual_IoT_Gateway/tree/Virtual-Lab-1-Host/Ansible[see details]_


*Now you are ready to proceed with the Labs! Have fun!*
