After completing the install precedure, register and upgrade your RHEL installation:


```
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager register --username=rhnuser --password=rhnpasswd`
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=pool_id
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo yum upgrade
